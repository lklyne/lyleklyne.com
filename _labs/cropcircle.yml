  ###Project:
  Sourcing locally produced food at an affordable price can be challenging. 
  Why not work with your neighbors? 
  I envisioned a mobile platform to facilitate this process:
  a local, peer-to-peer economy that 
  allows people to trade food grown in urban gardens.

  ###Tools used:
  - Pen and paper
  - Omnigraffle
  - Photoshop
  - Axure RP
