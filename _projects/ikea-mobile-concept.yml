  ###Project:
  Ikea is scary. In this project, I imagined a smartphone 
  app tailored to the in-store shopping experience. It's focused on three actions: browsing products,
  compiling a list of desired items, and finding them in the warehouse. 

  ###Tools used:
  - Pen and paper
  - Omnigraffle
  - Axure RP
  - Photoshop
