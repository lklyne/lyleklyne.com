  ### Project:
  Some good friends took it upon themselves to visit every park in Seattle, WA.
  It turns out there are a lot of them, and when they finished they made a [lovely book](http://www.amazon.com/Reasons-Go-Outside-Seattle-Project/dp/0692203192/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1424413668&sr=8-1&keywords=reasons+to+go+outside) 
  documenting their experience.
  
  [Lola Migas](lolamigas.com), who designed the book, mocked up an accompanying website that I agreed to build. 
  I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the layout and [PayPal](http://paypal.com) for the e-commerce.

  ### Tools used:
  - Sublime Text
  - Bootstrap
  - JQuery
  - Paypal

  The website can be viewed live at [reasonstogooutside.com](http://reasonstogooutside.com).
