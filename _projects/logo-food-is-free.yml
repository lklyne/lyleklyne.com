  ##Project:
  [Food is Free](https://www.facebook.com/foodisfree) is a non-profit organization focused on urban
  gardening education and community organization. What started as a small grass roots movement in Austin, TX has
  gained global momentum â€” sister projects are popping up worldwide and their message reaches hundreds of thousands 
  people online. Last year they open-sourced a new logo, and I submitted a design. I was thrilled when they
  decided to use my design for the future identity of the organization.


  ##Process:
  

  
  ####Previous Logos:
  Their previous logos referenced growth and had a hand made aesthetic. They were appropriate for a small grass roots 
  organization, but failed to represent what the organization had become.

  ####Doodles:
  I wanted the new logo to continue this tribute to organic growth but also to demonstrate that [Food is Free](https://www.facebook.com/foodisfree)
  had become a global movement. The organization had grown up, and therefore I felt a 
  more polished and professional approach would best. I fired up Sketch and saught out to create a monogram using leaves.

  ####Simpler, thicker:
  This was a good start. I liked the top design the most and saught to further simplify it.
  I thickened everything up and removed the two-tone colors and gradients. Here are varying degrees of thickness.

  ####Final mongram: 
  I rounded out the point where the leaves connect to the stem, and thickened up the base
  of the stems. These are subtle changes, but the rounded corners are more welcoming. The thick base
  adds balance and a sense of groundedness to the design.

  ####Incorporating text:

  I chose to use Brandon Grotesque because it conveys a bold and clear message while still feeling
  welcoming and warm. I presented [Food is Free](https://www.facebook.com/foodisfree) with several ways to incorporate text - they preferred the top center.
