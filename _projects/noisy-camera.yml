  ###Project:
  I thought it would be fun to design a camera that made some 
  noise before snapping a picture, in hopes of having a more attentive subject. 
  I focused on designing an interface that allows the user to trigger a 
  sound as many times as necessary then quickly transition to taking a picture.

  I ultimately settled on a sound bar along either side of the capture 
  button, allowing the user to drag their finger back and forth until 
  they are ready to take a picture. When the moment arrives, they can 
  drag their finger to the capture button to take the shot. This enables 
  the user to trigger and capture with a single finger, using a gesture 
  that does not require multiple taps.
