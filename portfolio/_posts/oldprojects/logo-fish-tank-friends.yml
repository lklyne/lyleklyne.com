  ###Project:
  [Fish Tank Friends](https://www.facebook.com/fishtankfriends) is a forward thinking 
  beat collective based in the Pacific Northwest. When they approached me to redesign
  their logo, I happily said yes.


  ### Process:
  Their previous logo incorporated nautical themes and a hand drawn aesthetic.

  I liked elements of the anchor/seal, and so I first saught to distill this idea into a mongram
  that doubled as an anchor while maintaining the nautical feel.

  After playing around with outlines and colors, I felt like it had lost its identity
  while becoming too busy and goofy. I returned to the FTF initials, thickened it up, and
   hardened the edges.

  All it needed was some context. An outline illuding to the tank did just the trick.
