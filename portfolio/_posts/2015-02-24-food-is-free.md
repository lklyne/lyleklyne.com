  Last year Food Is Free open-sourced a new logo, and I submitted a design. I was thrilled when they
    decided to use my design for the future identity of the organization.

## Project
[Food is Free](https://www.facebook.com/foodisfree) is a non-profit organization focused on urban gardening education and community organization. What started as a small grass roots movement in Austin, TX has gained global momentum â€” sister projects are popping up worldwide and their message reaches hundreds of thousands people online. 


## Process

#### Previous Logos
Their previous logos referenced growth and had a hand made aesthetic. They were appropriate for a small grass roots
organization, but I believe failed to represent what the organization had become.

#### Doodles
  I wanted the new logo to continue this tribute to organic growth but also to demonstrate that [Food is Free](https://www.facebook.com/foodisfree)
  had become a global movement. The organization had grown up, and therefore I felt a
  more polished and professional approach would best. I sought to create a monogram using leaves.

#### Refinement
This was a good start. I liked the top design the most and sought to further simplify it.
I thickened everything up and removed the two-tone colors and gradients. Here are varying degrees of thickness.

#### Final Monogram
I rounded out the point where the leaves connect to the stem, and thickened the base
of the stems. The rounded corners are more welcoming, and the thick base
balances and grounds the design.

#### Incorporating text
