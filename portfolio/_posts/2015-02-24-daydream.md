overview: |
  Daydream is a prototyping platform designed to test alternatives to the overhead lighting typically found in commercial spaces. We tested various lighting scenarios with the following questions in mind: How can indoor lighting be improved to feel more organic and natural? Can a lighting array assist in emergency situations? What is the effect of lighting on mood, chronobiology, and health?

#### Process

## Problem
Drop ceiling lighting is both ubiquitous and unsightly. With high rise buildings and public spaces regularly being renovated for modern use, architecture firms and the institutions they serve are seeking new lighting solutions that can work with existing infrastructure.

LED lighting is quickly becoming a more affordable, more energy efficient alternative to fluorescent lighting. As we will prove out with our prototype and user testing, an LED array has the flexibility to provide a much wider selection of lighting scenarios, including more natural, humanistic lighting and special case lighting for emergencies. Companies such as Philips are looking at OLED technology that can make a light as thin as a sheet of paper that can bend - opening up a whole new world of potential smart lighting and smart ceilings. Our prototype is intended to be a first step towards this new technology.

## Concept exploration
Before we had decided to focus on fluorescent-box-lighting, we generally knew we wanted to explore the realm of lights. We began by creating 2x2 matrices to find interesting new problem areas. The first explores matrix explores notions of portability. Is this something you carry on your person, plug in and occasionally move, or is it completely stationary?



This second matrix compares size and innovation. Fluorescent-box-lighting stood out as something that was ubiquitous yet ugly. We began to get excited about the idea of innovating a problem space that would have wide application.

### Refinement & Planning

Knowing that we wanted to improve on luorescent-box-lighting, we decided it would be best to build a scale model to prototype solutions. A full scale prototype would have been ideal but was out of scope for the time frame of the project. We sketched some ideas for a model that could be used to test initial ideas and assumptions.

## Construction
The first step was to build a model in Rhino, this model was then used for part-planning.

Sheets of acrylic were laser cut, then glued together using a bonding solution.

LED strips were hand soldered into a single array of 9 x 5 (45 all together).

<img src="../../../images/projects/daydream/build-02.jpg" alt="Build 3 Daydream" data-action="zoom">

The array was then added to the model.

...and connected to our software platform via the Fadecandy breakout board.

A Fadecandy library was tweaked and used to run video on the lighting array.

The GUI for selecting videos was hand built.

Videos for controlling individual LEDs were built in After Effects.

Lighting scenarios were tested with placeholder furniture.

Once we were confident in the lighting scenarios, we continued to improve the fidelity of the model with 3D printed furniture.

...and put finishing touches on the outside of the model...

...for presentation at the Marker Space Salon.

## Future work

Our physical prototype was focused on lighting of public spaces with drop ceiling lighting, however we can imagine a myriad of future applications- including warehouses, large department stores, outdoor covered platforms (such as that found at airports).

Another area of potential work is in creating the user interface for controlling the array - this would including a wall-mounted device (similar to nest) as well as a web-based interface where customers could create and share custom lighting scenarios.
