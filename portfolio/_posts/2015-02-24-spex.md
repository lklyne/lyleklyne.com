overview: |
  I participated in concept development and lead interaction and interface design for a mobile companion app for conceptual glasses called Spex. Spex are intelligent glasses that use a two way camera to unobtrusively check in with you throughout the day. Using data from pupillometry and facial recognition, Spex can tell how you feel and captures pictures and videos that matter to you. At the end of the day, choose what you want to keep from a gestural mobile interface.

## Problem
Data and media creation are exploding. As cameras become smaller and wearable, how will we manage the massive amount of information they create?

## Research

The team began by conducting market research of current point-of-view cameras. We looked at existing products such as GoPro and Google Glass and looked into the future impact these devices will have on society. We also discussed the relationship we have with technology using personal experiences and movie clips from Her, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and Man with a Movie Camera. Finally we discussed how we currently record and manage photos and video. 

#### Insights:

- Existing point of view cameras are large and unwieldy

- People generally feel uncomfortable when they are being recorded

- Existing interfaces for point-of-view cameras can be unintuitive

- Managing and retrieving the massive amount of media generated by POV cameras sucks

## Design

#### The glasses are...
- Unobtrusive and transparent: put them on and go about your normal day. Forget about them. They will pay attention to you, but you don’t have to return the favor.

- Encouraging of good behavior: don’t worry about taking your camera out when you see something interesting or beautiful. If you want to spex to capture something, pause and take it in. Smile. These are things we should all be doing — spex is a subtle reminder to stay present.

- Easy on your personal time (and hard drive): Spex wont overload you with media, but if they miss something, don’t worry. There is a complete history of your day that you can dig through to find that special gem. This information is yours alone and available for 24 hours.


## Interface
I lead interaction design for my team. I began by looking at several options for displaying saved data. I decided that flagged moments should be the primary focus of the mobile interface, and the unedited stream should be tucked away and only viewable when it’s needed. I explored several directions for the UI. Here are some of them:

#### Tiles & Gesture
With the goal of making the sorting process fun and intuitive, I settled on a gesture controlled tile system. Drag up (away) to delete, drag down (towards) to save, and drag right to expand. (My first version, displayed below, had this action reversed. After actually using it I realized it should be swapped.) As the user holds their finger down, the tile expands to display larger photos or play videos. To communicate the interaction to my classmates, I created this prototype in a couple of minutes using Principle.

#### High Fidelity
After confirming the interaction model was successful through testing of the prototype. I moved on to creating the final comp and flow. The final result is an interactive prototype that could be run on a phone during our product video.

The logo animates to mirror the home / save button on the mobile application.
