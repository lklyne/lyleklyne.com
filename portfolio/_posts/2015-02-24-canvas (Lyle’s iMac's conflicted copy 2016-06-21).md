## Problem
Canvas lacks continuity, clarity and flexibility. How can the experience be improved for students and teachers?

#### Background
Canvas is a learning management system (LMS)  that supports student and teacher education needs. For students, it provides a means to access course information and interact with their teacher and classmates. It meets organizational needs by supporting single-sign in (you are able to log in with your school id) and being FERPA compliant (it meets privacy standards set by the U.S. Board of education). Although the platform is owned by Instructure, it allows implementation of open-source modules, meaning that institutions can build custom tools and plugins and share them with a broader community.
