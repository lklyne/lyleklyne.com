  ### Project:
  When I interviewed for a summer internship at [Instrument](http://www.instrument.com/), they asked
  applicants to create something using one of their two mantras. 
  I selected "make the complex simple" and decided to make an animated site 
  that shows the lifecycle of a coffee bean. At each step, I provide a brief overview of
  how flavor is affected. 

  Here it is: [Coffee Basics](animation)
