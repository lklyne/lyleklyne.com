		<div>ProcessingAfter the cherry is picked, the fruit and mucilage are removed to expose the bean. There are three methods for doing this.</div>
		<div>Embark</div>
		<div>Espresso:A brewing method where a small amount of hot water is forced through finely ground coffee. The resulting 1.5 to 2 ounce beverage is incredibly complex. Espresso can be combined with other liquids or consumed on its own. 

</div>
		<div>BrewingThe beans are broken up and dissolved in water, creating a tasty beverage.</div>
		<div>Other:There are countless other brewing methods. They all involve using more water, less pressure and a slower extraction time than espresso. This leads to a more volumous beverage and a more consistant flavor output.</div>
		<div>It’s hard work, tooA lot of people go to great lengths to make it tasty. Let’s take a look at the key steps.
</div>
		<div>Washed:The cherries are loaded into a depulping machine, then sliced open to remove the beans. The mucilage is then removed in a fermentation tank or mechanically. This method leads to a bright, clean cup with less body and a mild flavor.

</div>
		<div>Semi-washed:The beans are removed the same way as in the washed method, however the mucilage is removed in carefully tended drying beds. This method leads to intense sweetness, heightened mouthfeel and balanced acidity.

</div>
		<div>Coffee is complexIt has over 800 aromatic flavor compounds! Compare this with approxomately 200 for wine.


</div>
		<div>Natural:The cherries are sun-dried with the beans inside until they are the texture of fruit leather, then they are peeled. Some of the mucilage remains, leading to a heavy body and mouthfeel, lower acidity, and exotic wild berry flavors.</div>
		<div>Brewing</div>
		<div>RoastingThe beans are roasted to enhance their natural flavors and characteristics.</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Coffee BasicsA flavor journey from bean to cup.</div>
		<div>Beginning</div>
		<div>Terroir:Flavor is also impacted by the natural environment where a coffee is produced. This includes climate, soil, and altitude, and how these factors interact with plant genetics. Coffees grown at higher altitudes are ideal as they produce denser beans more rich in flavor. </div>
		<div>Varietal:Flavor is first impacted by the genetics of the coffee tree. There are numerous varieties, but they can be grouped into two major categories: arabica and robusta. Arabica coffees are more difficult to grow but produce a much higher quality product.

</div>
		<div>Cultivation</div>
		<div>Portfolio</div>
		<div>Processing</div>
		<div>Caramelization:From roughly 200-375 °F the coffee bears are browned and caramelized, enhancing their natural flavors and sweetness. They release a large amount of water, expand, and release chaff. 

</div>
		<div>The TreeCoffee begins as a fruit, known as the cherry, which is grown on a tree.</div>
		<div>Roasting</div>
		<div>Maillard Reaction:From 375-450 °F the beans undergo the Maillard reaction - this results in a dark brown, crisp and brittle bean. This process creates the roasted flavor we associate with all coffee.</div>
