<p>Data and media creation are exploding. As cameras become smaller and wearable, how will we manage the massive amount of information they create?</p>

<h4 id="the-glasses-are">The glasses are…</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unobtrusive and transparent: put them on and go about your normal day. Forget about them. They will pay attention to you, but you don’t have to return the favor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encouraging of good behavior: don’t worry about taking your camera out when you see something interesting or beautiful. If you want to spex to capture something, pause and take it in. Smile. These are things we should all be doing — spex is a subtle reminder to stay present.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Easy on your personal time (and hard drive): Spex wont overload you with media, but if they miss something, don’t worry. There is a complete history of your day that you can dig through to find that special gem. This information is yours alone and available for 24 hours.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interaction-design">Interaction Design</h3>
<p>I looked at several options for displaying saved data. I decided that flagged moments should be the primary focus of the mobile interface, and the unedited stream should be tucked away and only viewable when it’s needed.</p>

<h3 id="tiles--gesture">Tiles &amp; Gesture</h3>
<p>With the goal of making the sorting process fun and intuitive, I settled on a gesture controlled tile system. Drag up (away) to delete, drag down (towards) to save, and drag right to expand. As the user holds their finger down, the tile expands to display larger photos or play videos. To communicate the interaction to my classmates, I created this prototype in a couple of minutes using Principle.</p>

<p>After confirming the interaction model was successful through testing of the prototype. I moved on to creating the final comp and flow. The final result is an interactive prototype that could be run on a phone during our product video.</p>

            <h6>Summary</h6>
            <p>I participated in concept development and lead interaction and interface design for a mobile companion app for conceptual glasses called Spex. Spex are intelligent glasses that use a two way camera to unobtrusively check in with you throughout the day. Using data from pupillometry and facial recognition, Spex can tell how you feel and captures pictures and videos that matter to you. At the end of the day, choose what you want to keep from a gestural mobile interface.
