**As a kid**, I loved making, building, and exploring (as most kids do). This desire stuck with me into adulthood and through work and play that included international policy, sound design, technical support, fine arts, web development, and craft coffee. A few years ago, I discovered all these interests can coexist under the umbrella of Human-Computer Interaction. That's crazy, you say! Next time you see me, feel free to ask me how.

**For work,** I'm a designer with an understanding of how people from different cultures interact and connect. I enjoy all parts of the product development cycle, but I most enjoy meeting people, learning about their needs and how they see the world, and translating what I find into simple design solutions.

**In my spare time**, you can find me tromping around taking pictures ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lyleklyne/)), making music ([Soundcloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/deepbrunch)), or trying to break the latest prototyping/design tool I downloaded ([ðŸ’¨.ws](http://xn--ks8h.ws/)). 

Nice to meet you,

Lyle
