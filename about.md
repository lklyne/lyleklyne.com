I’m Lyle Klyne, a product and interaction designer with an understanding of how people from different cultures interact and connect. I identify and resolve complex needs through simple design, leveraging my background in visual and interactive design with an empathetic understanding of software development. 

My background includes fine arts, sound design, international policy, web development, and a master’s degree in HCI + Design. I aim to create ethical products with both purpose and reach, and if they can make people smile, even better.

Nice to meet you,

Lyle
