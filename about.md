<div class="bio" markdown="1">

  
Iâ€™m <b>Lyle Klyne</b>, a Seattle-based designer making products and experiences at <a href="http://intentionalfutures.com">Intentional Futures</a>. I'm focused on projects that involve community & collaboration, global efforts and emerging technology.

I received a Bachelors in [International Relations](https://jsis.washington.edu/) and a Masters in [Human-Computer Interaction & Design](https://mhcid.washington.edu) at the University of Washington.

In my spare time, you can find me taking pictures ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lyleklyne/)),  making sounds ([Soundcloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/deepbrunch)), or trying to break the latest prototyping tool ([ðŸ’¨.ws](http://xn--ks8h.ws/)) I could get my ðŸ™Œ 's on. 

Nice to meet you,

Lyle
