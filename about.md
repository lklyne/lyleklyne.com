I am a designer and front-end developer based in the Pacific Northwest. I care deeply about functional and organic design, and I love projects that mitigate world problems, help people collaborate, and increase sustainability.  

 
I’m currently taking on new projects — if you’d like to work together feel free to get in touch.
