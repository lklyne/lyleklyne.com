I consider myself a researcher, a developer, and a designer with an affinity for distilling complexity. My background in International Relations lead to a fascination with design as a method for bringing people together and solving humanitarian problems.

Seeking inspiration in the natural world, old and emerging technology, and people’s stories, I’m an “experience-gatherer” by nature. My background includes fine arts, sound design, international policy, web development, and a master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction + Design ([MHCI+D](http://mhcid.washington.edu/)). I aim to create ethical products with both purpose and reach.

Nice to meet you,

Lyle
